In this project let's build **Nxt Mart** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a component, displaying that data, routing concepts, authentication and authorization, and adding responsiveness to the website.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. You can request for the feedback after your project submission in the discussions.

### Project Submission Instructions

- For Mini Projects, you can submit the test cases at your own pace. But we suggest you to submit the code to know the percentage of completion through test cases and that score will be considered for your interviews.

- Also it's important to publish your code frequently using `Step - 4` in the Instructions tab.

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
